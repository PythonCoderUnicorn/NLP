"@JohnTory Helping small businesses, sure. But helping them by way of setting a good example for their customers to wear masks, stopping the spread, and finish what you started trying to end the pandemic? Nope. It would cost you nothing. Wear a mask. Lead!! #CovidIsntOver #toronto #maskup"

"@TIFF_NET Another day another vote for prolonging the pandemic. Thanks alot #tiff22 for your unnecessary, selfish Spreader event. But film distributors making those bucks wheeling n dealing ""in person"" so who cares about anyone in #Toronto! #covidisnotover #CovidisAirborne"
