This section is about the _Text Mining with R_ book by Julia Silge and David Robinson, but 
delivered in a different way and with different examples. This section is not trying to copy nor reproduce their work, but with the goal of showing real world examples. This section will not 
do much explaining of concepts as the original material covers that. 

If you read this book without reading the _Text Mining with R_ book first, you will still 
hopefully be able to follow along and understand the functions. This section covers most of 
the book but not everything, the code here is reduced and simplified.
