The content in the section has most of the content from Quanteda's tutorials, with each section adapted to be similar but different. Some topics are not covered in this section such as Wordfish, Regular regression classifier, Topic Models, etc. as to not reproduce a full tutorial series but to show main parts of the library.


This section is for the Quanteda tutorials, which has 3 components (object types).

The 3 object types:

1. `corpus` = character strings and variables in data frames, combines texts with document level variables

2. `tokens` = tokens in a list of vectors, keeping the position of words

3. `document-feature-matrix` (DFM) = represents frequencies in a document in a matrix, no positions of words, can use bag-of-words analysis
